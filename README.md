h3>Hello and welcome to my 'Readme', the Readme will give you lot's of information about the Database that I have constructed.</h3><br>

<p>The Data Base has been constructed for my Code Institute Data Centric Development milestone project.</p><br>

<h2>UX.</h2><br>

<p>I built a Supercar Database at first with a database list of supercars a couple of facts about each supercar and asked my friends and family for feedback.</p><br>

<p><strong>Feedback received was.</strong></p>

<ol>

<li>Not enough cars.</li>
<li>Place a custom logo to make it your own.</li>
<li>Could you add a specifications list.</li>
<li>Colour scheme needed to change.</li>

</ol>

<p><strong>
So the feedback was taken onboard and changes were made.
</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>10 cars now added.</li>
<li>A spec list with 18 items now added.</li>
<li>A unique logo depicting a supercar now added.</li>
<li>The colour scheme has now been changed.</li>
</ol>
